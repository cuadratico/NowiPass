# NowiPass

- NowiPass is a trust manager that uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt your information, specifically the AES256 encryption algorithm and is usually used in GCM mode.

- NowiPass also uses KeyStore which is a secure storage of cryptographic keys.

- NowiPass also has extras such as a password strength qualifier that uses the entropy formula and a generator that uses its own algorithm to generate passwords.

- NowiPass has various security features such as the ability to store a record of your logins.

- NowiPass is oriented towards the security and freedom of the user, that is why the information is only stored locally and the user has the possibility of completely deleting it whenever they want.
